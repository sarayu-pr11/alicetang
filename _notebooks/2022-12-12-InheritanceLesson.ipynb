    "### Inheritance\n",
    "- the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class\n",
    "- without inheritance, you have to rewrite methods in each different class\n",
    "- with inheritance, create a superclass vehicle which is extended by subclasses (don't have to rewrite methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "- public class A {...}\n",
    "- public class B extends A {...}\n",

    "### Overriding\n",
    "- @Override is used to give different implementations to method of superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance Hierachies\n",
    "- superclasses and subclasses are gernally organized into a single root tree strucutre called an inheritance hierachy \n",
    "- lower levels of hierchy inherit attributes and methods from upper level\n",
    "- object type and refernce type can be different when instantiating an object variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "- utilized when a method is implemented to perform different tasks in different classes\n",
    "- allows method to take on multiple \"forms\" or implementations based on specific object it is acting upon "
