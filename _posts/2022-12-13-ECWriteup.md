## Main Takeaways and Reflection
Even if you start off with a different career like Kathyleen did, it is not too late to switch to a career in tech. Kris struggled in his CS classes but that ultiamtely didn't stop him. Career in tech can help you impact a lot of people (rewarding job). Kathyleen wasn't satisfied with her one to one impact during her investment banking job. Tech career means you contribute to helping people/the greater good. It is also important to focus on continuous learning, never stop learning. Esepcially since tech industry is always advancing, you need to continoulsy expand your knowledge to keep up. Kris said every time he changed companies, he would need to learn more promgramming languages. Knowing only a couple programming languages is the bare minimum for a CS career. The things we learn in this class (CSA and CSP) are applicable; Kris used Rest APIs at his job at twitter. Application to me, achieving success and continously learning in CSA is the first step for a successful career in tech.
