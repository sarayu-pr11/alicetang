## Part 1 Menu Exploration
- [Personal Menu](https://tangalice.github.io/alicetang/java/jupyter/2022/09/05/Menu.html)
- [Team Math Options Menu](https://sarayu-pr11.github.io/teamGrapeSnails/jupyter/2022/09/05/menu.html)
- [Team Repo](https://github.com/sarayu-pr11/teamGrapeSnails)

## Part 2 Documentation and Analysis
- Explain where a Class is defined
```
public class Menu {
```
You define a class whenever you need to add variables, objects or methods to your code. Here a class called Menu is being defined. It will hold  different variables, objects and methods. 

- Explain where an instances of a Class is defined
```
Painter myPainter = new Painter();
```
An instance of a class is defined when you create an object of that class. Here in Code.org a new object of the Painter class called myPainter is being created

- Explain where an object is Calling a Method
```
Menu.main(null);
```
An object calls a method when it wants to preform that action and execute the code. Here the Menu class is calling its main method to execute.

- Explain where an object is Mutating data
```
userNum = Integer.parseInt(userInputStr);
```
The Integer object is using the method parseInt to mutate the user input, which automatically enters as a string, into an interger. This integer is then stored in a new variable called userNum

- Describe Console, GUI differences, or Code.org differences.
A console is not as visual as the other two. It requires the user to enter inputs and returns respective outputs. To code, it requires a good understanding of script and syntax. The GUI (graphic user interface) is more user friendly because it has a visual display and it is a more clickable platform. But you can't really perform multiple tasks at once. On Code.org there is the painter as a visual object to help understand exactly how the code implements. The file and public class name should be the same. This platform is great for beginners to begin to learn how to code.
