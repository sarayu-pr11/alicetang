- #15 (A) : Choice I has a loop control variable k that starts at 1, increments by 1, and will terminate the loop when k has the value data.length. In each iteration, there is a check to see if the value before the current value is larger. If it is, false is returned because the elements would not be nondecreasing. For example, if data[k – 1] had the value 5 and data[k] had the value 4, then data would contain an instance where the values were decreasing. If all the elements are checked and no decreasing pairs of elements are found (the for loop ends without returning), the method will return true. Choice II has a loop control variable k that starts at 0, increments by 1, and will terminate the loop when k has the value data.length. In each iteration, there is a check to see if the current value is larger than the subsequent value. If it is, false is returned because elements would not be nondecreasing. For example, if data[k] had the value 5 and data[k + 1] had the value 4, then data would contain an instance where the values were decreasing. Unfortunately, since the indices of an array start at 0 and go through data.length – 1, when k has the value data.length – 1 an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown as the condition attempts to check data[data.length – 1] and data[data.length – 1 + 1] or data[data.length]. Choice III has a loop control variable k that starts at 0, increments by 1, and will terminate the loop when k has the value data.length – 1. In each iteration, there is a check to see if the current value is larger than the subsequent value. If it is, false is returned because elements would not be nondecreasing, otherwise true is returned. As a result, only data[0] and data[1] are examined. The remaining elements in data are not checked because the method will stop once a return statement is reached. This means that the method could return true even when there are consecutive elements in data that are nondecreasing.

- #18 (B) : The indices for myList are 0 through myList.size() – 1, for a total of myList.size() elements. Using Math.random()generates a random floating point number between 0 and 1, not including 1. When this value is multiplied by the number of elements we want in our range, myList.size(), a random floating point number between 0 and myList.size(), not including myList.size(), is generated. When this value is typecast as an int, the result is an integer value between 0 and myList.size() – 1 inclusive.

- #29 (E) : The original code segment prints all values between 1 and 100 that are evenly divisible by 4. The following values are printed: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, and 100. Choice E shows these values can also be printed by having a for loop that has a loop control variable k that starts at 4, increments by 4, and terminates when k is greater than 100.

- #31 (C) : Passing a reference parameter results in the formal parameter and the actual parameter being aliases. They both refer to the same object. Any updates made to the referenced array when mystery is called are being made on the single array that is reference by both data and values. The for loop has a loop control variable k that starts at 0, increments by 1 for each iteration, and the loop terminates once k is data.length – 1. In each iteration of the loop, the element at index k + 1 is assigned the sum of the values at index k and k + 1. In the first iteration, data[1] is assigned 5 + 2 (data[[0] + data[1]) or 7. Changing the array referenced by both data and values to be {5, 7, 1, 3, 8}. In the second iteration, data[2] is assigned 8, changing the array to {5, 7, 8, 3, 8}. In the third iteration, data[3] is assigned 11, changing the array to {5, 7, 8, 11, 8}. In the fourth and final iteration, data[4] is assigned 19, changing the array to {5, 7, 8, 11, 19}. Since call by value is used when calling mystery and passing an array, the reference to the array values is passed, meaning data will be assigned this same reference. This establishes an aliasing relationship where both values and data are referencing the same array and no copy of the array is made. Any updates made when mystery is called are being made on the single array that is reference by both data and values.

- #34 (B) : Choice 2 correctly creates a new point with the two paramerter Point constructor that assigns a to x and b to y. Choice 1 and 3 use the no paramater point constructor which incorrectly assigns 0 to both x and y. Choice 3 attempts to update x and y individually but they are variables in Point that cannot be accessed direclty from circle. This code will cause a compile runtime error.
