## Reflection
Since we needed a "fun" feature on our project website we chose to build the number game 2048. At N@TM, the game was a success because people seemed really interested in trying to play the game. I looked at another team's websites which also happened to be about statistics. They recreated the data graphing feature of stapplet. I thought that was really cool and I think we coudl take inspireation from them and do the same for our stats website. Another team made a car website with a google maps API to find local car dealerships; I thought that was pretty interesting. My team and I also went to the other classrooms and looked at 3D animation, pottery, and painting and drawing. I was impressed with how detailed the creations were for the 3D animation 1 class. They looked way cooler than what I made when I was in 3D animation 1. I also saw a pottery bear that looked really professional. For painting and drawing, I saw audrey's artworks. She got a 5 on the AP exam for them. They were really good.
