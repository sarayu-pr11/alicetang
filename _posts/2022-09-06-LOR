Original Letter of Rec Prep: 
When I first contacted you about writing a letter of rec for me for a summer internship you asked for 3 of my best moments from computer science principles. 
Here is exactly what I wrote:

- One very memorable moment for me was the end of trimester 1 of AP CSP. For the FINAL CSP Video I was asked along with a couple other students to help grade other people’s videos because the video I had made was very good and successfully connected all the college board topics to my work from the TRI. This moment in CSP is pretty important to me because prior to this happening I was intimidated by all of the computer science principles concepts which lead me to be very quiet in class and not participate as much during team live reviews. But I felt like my accomplishments had been recognized at this moment which lead me to be more confident in my programming skills during trimester 2. The increase and confidence also encouraged me to speak up more during discussions. 

- Another memorable moment for me was the mid term vocabulary live review. Samaya was my partner and we got live reviewed together. I felt that this live review was different from all the previous ones. A really good conversation took place. It went beyond just what the vocab words meant and we discussed how the terms/concepts related to our code. I started seeing live reviews as an opportunity to further my knowledge and expand on what I had already learned instead of just a review to get a grade.  

- A third memorable moment for me was when I got my cat facts API to work near the start of the second trimester. I had struggled for a bit and could not get my API to work. So I came in during tutorial for the first time to ask you for help. Previously I had been hesitant to reach out for help because I wasn’t confident in my programming skills at all. But after we worked together and I finally got my API to run correctly it was really rewarding for me. 


Additions to the Original Letter:
Here is some progress I made in or through your classes following the original letter of rec

- I felt confident enough to apply to an REHS internship because I took your AP CSP class. I applied for a project about the Visualization of Ultradian Rhythms in Sleep EEG and MEG. This internship required me to be familar with the Python language and just computer science in general because I would be working with a language that I've never encountered called MatLab


Last spring, when I saw a project called The Visualization of Ultradian Rhythms in Sleep 
EEG and MEG, I was immediately hooked. I’ve always had an interest towards sleep cycles, dreams and sleep paralysis. On top of that, it involved a programming language I’ve never encountered called MatLab. 

During the 8 week summer REHS internship at the San Diego Super Computer Center, I worked with a UCSD researcher to program different algorithms in MatLab to transform raw EEG and MEG sleep data from 4 human subjects into visualizations like 2D Topographic Brain Maps and 3D Spatiotemporal Isosurfaces.
