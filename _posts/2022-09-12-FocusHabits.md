## Notes of Gratitude
Dear Mom, I am so grateful that you are always there for me. Even when I have to ask you about the most simple questions when I'm doing homework, you always immediately stop what you are doing to help me. I feel comfortable to talk to you about whatever I want. I'm so lucky to have such a supportive mom.

Dear Mrs. Ayres, I am so grateful to have had you as my US history teacher. Your lessons were always so engaging and you put so much thought into them. I'm grateful you had so much passion for teaching and that made me look forward to your class everyday.
